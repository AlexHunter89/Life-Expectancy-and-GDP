  2. Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations.
  3. Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations.
  4. Preprocess, explore, and analyze data.
  5. Analyze the GDP and life expectancy data of six countries.
  6. Prepare and clean the data for analysis.
  7. Plot the data to visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
  8. Answer key questions about the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
  9. Create a blog post to share findings on the World Health Organization website.
- **Deliverables:**
  1. Cleaned and prepared dataset.
  2. Data analysis report.
  3. Visualizations and plots showing the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
  4. Blog post summarizing the findings.
