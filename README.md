# Life Expectancy and GDP Starter
### Project Scope Document

#### Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Analysis of GDP and Life Expectancy
- **Project Description:** This project aims to analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to identify the relationship between GDP and life expectancy of six countries.
- **Objectives:**
  1. Complete a project to add to your portfolio.
  2. Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations.
  3. Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations.
  4. Preprocess, explore, and analyze data.
  5. Analyze the GDP and life expectancy data of six countries.
  6. Prepare and clean the data for analysis.
  7. Plot the data to visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
  8. Answer key questions about the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
  9. Create a blog post to share findings on the World Health Organization website.
- **Deliverables:**
  1. Cleaned and prepared dataset.
  2. Data analysis report.
  3. Visualizations and plots showing the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
  4. Blog post summarizing the findings.
